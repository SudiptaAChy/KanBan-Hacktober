## Getting Started with Kanban Board
Kanban is a “ start with what you do now ” system. That means you do n’t have to extract what you ’re doing to get started with kanban. The kanban system assumes three effects:
- You understand current processes, as they're actually rehearsed, and admire current places, liabilities, and job titles.
- You agree to pursue nonstop enhancement through evolutionary change.
- You encourage acts of leadership at every position- from individual contributors to elderly operation.
## Elements of a kanban board
Basic elements and functions of Kanban which needs to be in the app:
  - __Visual Cards__: One of the first effects you ’ll notice about a kanban board are the visual cards( stickies, tickets, or else). Kanban brigades write all of their systems and work particulars onto cards, generally one per card. For nimble brigades, each card could synopsize one stoner story. formerly on the board, these visual signals help teammates and stakeholders snappily understand what the platoon is working on.
  - __Columns__: Another hallmark of the kanban board are the columns. Each column represents a specific exertion that together compose a "workflow". Cards flow through the workflow until completion. Workflows can be as simple as "To Do," "In Progress," "Complete," or much more complex.
  - __Work in progress limits__: WIP limits are the maximum number of cards that can be in one column at any given time. A column with a WIP limit of three can not have further than three cards in it. When the column is “ maxed- eschewal ” the platoon needs to swarm on those cards and move them forward before new cards can move into that stage of the workflow. These WIP limits are critical for exposing backups in the workflow and maximizing inflow. WIP limits give you an early warning sign that you committed to too important work.
  - __Commitment point__: Kanban brigades frequently have a backlog for their board. This is where guests and teammates put ideas for systems that the platoon can pick up when they're ready. The commitment point is the moment when an idea is picked up by the platoon and work starts on the design.
  - __Delivery Point__: The delivery point is the end of a kanban platoon’s workflow. For utmost brigades, the delivery point is when the product or service is in the hands of the client. The platoon’s thing is to take cards from the commitment point to the delivery point as presto as possible. The ceased time between the two is the called Lead Time. Kanban brigades are continuously perfecting to drop their lead time as much as possible.
